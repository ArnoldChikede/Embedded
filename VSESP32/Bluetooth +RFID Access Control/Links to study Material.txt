Some of the mostimportant nots on SPI are 

	full duplex
	by default when you send a bit you are always receiving a bit at the same time
	so you have to read the received bits even if you don't want them, be it dummy bits or useful bits, you still got to read them because there will be a buffer overflow if you dont 
        SDI=MISO
	SDO=MOSI 
	CS= Chip select
	CLK=serial clock 

	The high-speed signals of an SPI interface limit its data transfer only over short distances

Some part UART communication

	Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
	The word Asynchronous simply means that There is no shared clock as in the SPI comm protocol wch removes the Synchronous part from the context 
	Serial simply meaning that bits are sent one fter the other 
	Baud rate is agreed on before starting thereby the clk isnt present 
	hERE its more like deciding say after each and evry 10s we shall have a a transfer of bits and we hope this will happpen ifthere is a mistake e trys to recieve at 11s ..we miss the info
